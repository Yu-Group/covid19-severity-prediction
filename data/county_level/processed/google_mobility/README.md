This dataset is intended to help remediate the impact of COVID-19. It
shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes.

It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans.
Each Community Mobility Report dataset is presented by location and
highlights the percent change in visits to places like grocery stores and
parks within a geographic area.

Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from
region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes
between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g.
rural versus urban areas).

We’ll leave a region or category out of the dataset if we don’t have
sufficient statistically significant levels of data. To learn how we
calculate these trends and preserve privacy, read About this data below.

These datasets show how visits and length of stay at different places change
compared to a baseline. We calculate these changes using the same kind of
aggregated and anonymized data used to show popular times for places in
Google Maps.

Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week:
- The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week,
  during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020. 
- The datasets show trends over several months with the most recent data
  representing approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how long it takes to produce
  the datasets. What data is included in the calculation depends on user
  settings, connectivity, and whether it meets our privacy threshold. If the
  privacy threshold isn’t met (when somewhere isn’t busy enough to ensure
  anonymity) we don’t show a change for the day. As a result, you may encounter
  empty fields for certain places and dates.  

We include categories that are useful to social distancing efforts as well as access to essential services.

We calculate these insights based on data from users who have opted-in to Location History for their Google Account, so the data represents a sample of our users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behavior of a wider population.
