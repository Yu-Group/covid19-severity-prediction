# About this data (copied from Apple Website)

The CSV file and charts on this site show a relative volume of directions
requests per country/region, sub-region or city compared to a baseline volume
on January 13th, 2020. We define our day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific
time. Cities are defined as the greater metropolitan area and their
geographic boundaries remain constant across the data set. In many
countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities, relative volume has increased
since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day
of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. Data that is
sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random,
rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of individual movements
and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about our users, so
we can’t make any statements about the representativeness of usage against
the overall population.
